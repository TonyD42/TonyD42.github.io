<h2> The Yurts at Pacific Trails </h2>
<dt><strong>What is a yurt?</strong></dt> 
	<dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground.<br>
		Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dt>
<dt><strong> How are the yurts furnished?</strong></dt>
	<dd>Each yurt is finished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove.<br>
		The luxury camping experience also includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold<br> 
		running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.
<dt><strong> What should I bring</strong></dt>
	<dd>Bring a sense of adventure and some time to relax! Most guests also pack comfortable <br>
		walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with layers of clothing.</dd>
